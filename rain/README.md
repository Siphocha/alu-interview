# Rain
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1, as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map, calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

This project calculates amount of rainwater that can be retained, given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls. 

Each unit of height corresponds to a wall of unit width 1, simulating a cross-section of a relief map.
